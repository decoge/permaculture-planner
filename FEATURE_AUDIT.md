## 🔥 Immediate Action Items

### To Convert Free → Paid
Users need to SEE the value before they pay. Add:
1. **Growth Simulation** (visual, impressive, shareable)
2. **Climate Risk Analysis** (practical, professional)
3. **Better onboarding** (show value immediately)
4. **Success stories** (social proof on pricing page)

### Current Gaps in User Flow
- ❌ After creating first design, user doesn't know what to do next
- ❌ No clear "aha moment" showing why this is better than paper
- ❌ Templates are locked behind Pro (should have 2-3 free templates)
- ❌ No sharing = no viral growth
